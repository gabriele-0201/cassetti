* TODO:

** Urgent:
[ ] ADJUST gui
    [x] optional expected bytes
    [x] remove default sync
    [ ] little gui to specify witch type of symbols are accepted
    [ ] define random symbol
[x] SNR based on ModDemod
    => specify something like double view
    + mod, channel, demod (This almost never make senso to show)
    + SNR
[ ] SNRdB bound
[ ] Correct BPSK SNR

** After Urgent

[ ] Finish implement last things in QAM

** low level:
[ ] adjust ModDemod trait
[ ] adjust Signal abstraction
