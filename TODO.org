* TODO:

** Urgent:
[x] ADJUST gui
    [x] optional expected bytes
    [x] remove default sync
[x] SNR based on ModDemod
    => specify something like double view
    + mod, channel, demod (This almost never make senso to show)
    + SNR
[x] SNRdB bound
[x] Correct BPSK SNR

[x] correct 64 QAM
[x] correct MQAM SNR

** After Urgent

[ ] QAM -> implement Sync and expected bytes

** low level priority:
[ ] Adjust ModDemod trait
[ ] Little gui to specify witch type of symbols are accepted (to being able to define the sync one)
[ ] define random sync symbol
[ ] accept aplitude of Htx
[ ] manage padding
[ ] Read from file + textbox where write stuff
[ ] create button to convert signals to wav
[ ] create button to save file
[ ] adjust Signal abstraction

[ ] error correction?

* Things to possibly do:

** Implement another modulation
** Fix all the current stuff
