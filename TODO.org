* TODO:

** Urgent:

[x] Something is really broken with the Es Energy of the BPSK (??)

[x] make expected bytes works!

[x] make padding
    -> not enough bit => 0
    -> more bit than expected => 0

[x] implement sync for MQAM -> NOT implement for MQAM but move the stuff in the BPSK to the ModDemod trait!!


[x] ADJUST gui
    [x] optional expected bytes
    [x] remove default sync
[x] SNR based on ModDemod
    => specify something like double view
    + mod, channel, demod (This almost never make senso to show)
    + SNR
[x] SNRdB bound
[x] Correct BPSK SNR

[x] correct 64 QAM
[x] correct MQAM SNR

** low level priority:
[ ] Adjust ModDemod trait

[ ] adjust Signal abstraction REALLY think about this!

[ ] refactor GUI

[ ] Little gui to specify witch type of symbols are accepted (to being able to define the sync one)

[ ] define random sync symbol

[ ] accept aplitude of Htx

[ ] Read from file + textbox where write stuff

[ ] create button to convert signals to wav
[ ] create button to save file


[ ] error correction?

* Things to possibly do:

** Implement another modulation
** Fix all the current stuff
** SNR - BER on the simulator
How you can use CALF: (doable but extremely complex)
+ hand made -> just using helvum and manually redirect the stuff every time
+ automated -> utilizing the depency 'pipewire' I should be able to every time cpal spawn a new output or input stream this will be attecched to CALF
