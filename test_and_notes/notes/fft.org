* FFT

** Polynomial Multiplication
Instead of multiply each coefficient per each coeffiecient => O(n^2)

Every polynomian of degrees d is represeted with d + 1 point,
now the product of the two polynomial is equal to the the multiplication
of the y point of the polynomials and than the points will be describe the
resultant polynomial => O(n)

Coefficint Rapresentation -> Coefficients into a vec
Value Rapresentation -> only d + 1 points are saved

** How works the conversion between Coefficient representation to Value -> *Evaluation*

The most straighforword solution is select some points and evaluate those -> but we return at the initial complexity
