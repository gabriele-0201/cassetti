## Things to know

### Hysterisis

This is the memory of the tape, 
if I record a new signal some of the older one will ramain,
this is due to the 'comportamento ferrogmanetico' non linear 
(quello a forma di sprile che non torna mai all'orgine che abbiamo fatto a Fisica 2)

### BIAS

This is an **High Energy High Frequency Signal**, added to the tape to
scramble all the old magnetic field (against hysterisis)

### Saturation

When the input is no longer maanged and there's no room for store anything else.
(Non linear input-output)


## Types

+ type\_one
+ type\_due
+ type\_four

# How it works

The width of the tape is 1/8 inch, and the tape speed is 1^(7/8) inches per second.

|--Left---|
|         | - Forward
|--Right--|
|--Left---|
|         | - Reverse
|--Right--|

The tape head will read automatically both left and right channel.

## Plastic cassette housing
+ contain rollers which guide the tape at the correct angle
+ there are various entry for:
    + erease head
    + record/playback head
    + capstan
    + pinch roller
+ There is a sprung pressure pad to keep pressed the tape against the head
    + behind the sprung pressure there is always a metal magnetic shield

## Dolby D noise reduction system

A way to redoce hiss caused by coarseness of magnetic particles (did not really understood)

## Alignment problem
-> The cassette tape must be properly aligned to get the best
The problem is that each recorder is poperly aligned for his cassette tape
and not for everyone

### Azimuth
