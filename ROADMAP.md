# ROADMAP

## Microcontroller Test
[ ] Micro HelloWorld
- First goal is to have some sort of hello world in Rust on some mirco
[ ] Soud Modifier
- Get audio input in analog way and try to modify it (if is possible) and reprocuce
  it on some sort of speaker

## Cassette and Recorder Test

[ ] Buy some audio cassette and a recorder (at least one)
[ ] Try to register something and being happy
[ ] Study how cassette tapes works
[ ] Open the recorder and hopefully understand how it works

## Connection between Micro and Recorder

[ ] Create the connection
- Create the fisical connection between recorder and the micro
  and implement some sort command managment
[ ] Try to record some audio propagating the input by the pc

## Modulation

[ ] Studing Information Theory
[ ] Understand what type of modulation is better
[ ] Studying error correction

## MicroAndModulation

[ ] Develop the modulator on the microcontroller
[ ] Accept a blob of byte and create the analog stuff

## Linux Kernel Module?

[ ] Connection between software and micro
- Understand if developing a kernel module is the better way to create the connection 
[ ] Develop a way to create a blob of bytes that will be stored on the cassette 
    

## FINAL

[ ] SAVE stuff on the cassette


# NEW ROADMAP

# Phase 0
## Cassette and Recorder Test
[ ] Buy some audio cassette and a recorder (at least one)
[ ] Try to register something and being happy

# Phase 1
## Microcontroller Test
[ ] Micro HelloWorld
- First goal is to have some sort of hello world in Rust on some mirco
[ ] Soud Modifier
- Get audio input in analog way and try to modify it (if is possible) and reprocuce
  it on some sort of speaker

## Connection between Micro and Recorder
[ ] Input in micro, output in recorder

# Phase 1
## Understand the Channel model
[ ] Varianza dell'awgn
[ ] Attenuazione
[ ] Understand how the channel works

[ ] Develop a way to test
1. create an emulator of the channel in python
2. connect pc and recorder to make tests

## Modulation
[ ] Studing Information Theory
[ ] Based on the tests done before understand what type of modulation is better
[ ] Studying error correction
 
## Capacity of the microcontroller
[ ] Understand what can I really do with the microcontroller

# Phase 2
## DevelopModulation
Based on the goal decided:
[ ] Develop the modulator on the microcontroller
[ ] Develop the modulator on the pc

[ ] Accept a blob of byte and create the analog stuff

## PC Software?
[ ] Connection between software and micro/recorder
- Understand if developing a kernel module is the better way to create the connection 
[ ] Develop a way to create a blob of bytes that will be stored on the cassette
